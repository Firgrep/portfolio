                    I'm a self-taught Software Developer with a PhD in Philosophy who powers his experience in every area of programming with a philosopherâ€™s ability to break down, communicate and solve complex problems. I'm particularly interested in modern web development and to understand how to build code that is readable, reusable and testable - and, not least of all, <i>logically coherent</i>.

                    <p style={{fontSize: "1.25rem"}}>
                    I journal my discoveries, mistakes, fascinations and other things that I learn in programming and web development in my <NavLink to="/blog" style={{color: "inherit"}}>blog</NavLink>.

                    Philosophy continues to be a significant part of my life. I teach philosophy courses at the <Link style={{color: "inherit"}} to="https://www.halkyonguild.org/academy" target="_blank">Halkyon Academy</Link>, which provides a spirited intellectual forum and mental gym at the convenience of one's home without the loss of quality. I also tutor privately for those who are philosophically intrepid and would like to tunnel deeper into a particular text.

                    <p style={{fontSize: "1.25rem"}}>
                    Poetry is another meaningful enterprise for me. In 2022, I published <i>Saedah: a poem of change</i>, an epic poem of 401 verses arrayed in five parts, which can be found <Link style={{color: "inherit"}} to="https://www.amazon.com/Saedah-poem-change-Filip-Niklas/dp/B0B7QGTN9R" target="_blank">here</Link>. 
                    </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize: "1.25rem"}}>
                    Apart from these intensities, I try to live a balanced life engaging in physical- and financial fitness, going to regularly to the gym and studying rational methods of investing. When I'm off-duty, I enjoy films, series, board-games and computer strategy games.
