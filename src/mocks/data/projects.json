Initially MSW (Mock Service Worker) was used to simulate API data calls under development but it discovered that, while this did technically work for production, a better long-term and scalable solution was found using a BaaS service like Firebase. However, MSW was still very helpful for initial testing and will be kept for future development. Bootstrap has been used mainly as 'CSS skeleton' for its helpful containers and its navbar, but MaterialUI has been used for buttons. EmailJS is used for contact form emails. Marked and DOMPurify is used to convert .md files into .html and to check for injections.",
